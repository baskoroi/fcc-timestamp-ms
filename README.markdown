# fcc-timestamp-ms

## Description

This is a timestamp microservice I developed while learning in FreeCodeCamp.

What this API/microservice does is that it takes a request with a string as its route parameter, then computes its UNIX timestamp and human-readable date string. The computed results will then be returned as a JSON object.

The string being the parameter must resemble either a UNIX timestamp or valid date string, otherwise only null values will be returned.
